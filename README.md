## What's this?
Fused Multiply Add‚Äôs complement or FMA's complement is a custom binary number system designed to calculate vector dot products.

FMA‚Äôs complement is still in R&D. The algorithm is somewhat slow, however, this [Medium Article](https://kibichomurage.medium.com/hashing-a-matrix-multiplication-in-c-a-friendly-introduction-to-fmas-complement-36ea1562a18d) guides programmers through a working implementation in the C language.

## Why is FMA's complement important?
‚úî **Dot product alternative** ‚Äî FMA‚Äôs complement opens up research into alternative algorithms for calculating vector dot products.

‚úî **Arithmetic on compressed forms** ‚Äî FMA‚Äôs complement compresses matrices and permits matrix multiplications in a compressed state. Decoding is not necessary.

‚úî **Cache awareness** ‚Äî FMA‚Äôs complement caches intermediate dot product results. This reduces the total number of CPU instructions needed to perform a matrix multiplication.

‚úî **Linear Basis multiplications** ‚Äî FMA‚Äôs complement permits one to calculate few vector dot products and guess (with reasonable accuracy) the results of related vector dot products.

This [tutorial](https://kibichomurage.medium.com/hashing-a-matrix-multiplication-in-c-a-friendly-introduction-to-fmas-complement-36ea1562a18d) covers getting started with FMA's complement.

The code in this repo is a prototype accompanying the tutorial.
